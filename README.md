# Jelly Player (jellyplayer)

This is my toy app of a music player that connects to a Jellyfin Server.

I created it because I wanted to be able to control the "recommendation algorithm" to use; and of course for fun.

I hope it can be useful for someone else who wants to play with the Jellyfin API. Or someone who wants to make a Quasar App.

Quasar & Vue chosen because it's what I know and like.

Shoutout to James Harvey from [finamp](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp) for the nice blog post that got me started: https://jmshrv.com/posts/jellyfin-api/
